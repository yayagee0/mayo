# Environment Variables for FamilyNest Mayo App

# Supabase Configuration (Production)
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# Development Mocking (Optional)
# Set to 'true' to use mock Supabase client instead of real one
# Useful for development without consuming Supabase egress quota
# VITE_USE_MOCKS=true

# Development Notes:
# - In test environments, mocks are always used regardless of VITE_USE_MOCKS
# - In production, real Supabase client is always used
# - VITE_USE_MOCKS only affects development mode (pnpm dev)
# - Realtime subscriptions are disabled in test/dev when mocks are enabled
