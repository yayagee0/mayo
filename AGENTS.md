## üß± SCHEMA & BACKEND RULES

- ‚ùÑÔ∏è The schema is **frozen** in `PHASE0_SCHEMA_LOCKED.sql` (now updated to Phase 2).  
- These tables are canonical and immutable without approval:  

  **Core (Phase 0)**  
  - `app_settings`  
  - `profiles`  
  - `items`  
  - `interactions`  

  **Extended (Phase 1)**  
  - `quiz_questions`  
  - `quiz_answers`  
  - `quiz_guesses`  
  - `reflections`  
  - `scenario_questions`  
  - `scenario_answers`  

  **Extended (Phase 2)**  
  - `islamic_questions` (Q&A with reassurance fields: `explanation_correct`, `explanation_incorrect`, categories, order_index)  

- All backend logic must **match exactly** what is in the schema file.  
- Supabase is used **only** for persistence ‚Äî not for dynamic roles, logic, or migrations.  
- ‚úÖ RLS must remain enabled for all tables.  
- ‚ùå No Supabase Edge Functions or additional services allowed.  

---

## üîê AUTH & ROLE ENFORCEMENT

- Google login is enforced via Supabase.  
- Only these **four hardcoded emails** are allowed (see `src/lib/server/allowlist.ts`).  
- Role detection and permissions are **handled in frontend only**.  
- Backend never controls visibility or access logic.  

---

## üé® FRONTEND UX PRINCIPLES

- Mobile-first, accessible, low-cognitive-load design.  
- Smart Cards render before feed; `BirthdayCard` mandatory if data exists.  
- Smart Card-first feed: Feed must show meaningful cards before content if empty.  
- Gentle UX: no gamification, no intrusive notifications.  
- Must support keyboard navigation, reduced motion preferences, and proper contrast.  

### Phase 2 Widget Visibility Rules
- **"What Would You Do?" (ScenarioCard)** ‚Üí children only (Yazid, Yahya).  
- **Reflections Digest & Scenario Digest** ‚Üí parents only (Ghassan, Mariem).  
- **Profession Card** updated roles & icons as defined in Phase 2 requirements.  
- **Age Playground** max age = 70 for Ghassan, 18 for others.  
- **Islamic Q&A** ‚Üí 1-2 questions per session, gentle reassurance explanations.  

---

## üß† DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- Schema-First: Data drives design. Schema never changes without PO approval.  
- Contractual AI: Copilot, codegen, or any LLM must obey this file and `PHASE0_SCHEMA_LOCKED.sql`.  
- No Dead Ends: All screens should offer CTAs or Smart Cards, never show blanks.  
- Single-Family Privacy: All storage, media, and feeds are locked to one household context.  

---

## üö´ PROHIBITED

- ‚ùå Do not install UI mega-libraries (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap).  
- ‚ùå Do not add new database tables, columns, triggers, or roles without PO approval.  
- ‚ùå Do not rely on runtime dynamic role assignment or permissions logic.  
- ‚ùå Do not use Supabase functions, webhooks, or realtime features.  

---

## üöß CURRENT SPRINT CONSTRAINTS

- ‚ùå Do not change login flow (/ ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí /dashboard).  
- ‚ùå Do not modify Supabase auth, allowlist, or baseline RLS policies.  
- ‚úÖ Focus on quality & stability improvements only.  
- ‚úÖ Fix TypeScript errors and add error boundaries.  
- ‚úÖ Implement shared stores for better state management.  
- ‚úÖ Enforce visibility rules on all widgets per Phase 2 specifications.  
- ‚úÖ Test Islamic Q&A reassurance flow and accessibility compliance.
